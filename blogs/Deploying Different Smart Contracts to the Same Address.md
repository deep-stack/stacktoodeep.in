## Introduction

- **CREATE** and **CREATE2** are two opcodes to deploy a smart contract, difference is
- Using **CREATE** new contracts are generated based on deployer address and nonce
  - Addresses generated using **CREATE** are still somehwhat diterministic like if you know the deployer nonce
  - Nonce starts from **0** and increments by 1 on every succesful **CREATE** call
- Using **CREATE2** new contracts are generated based on deployer address, salt, separator constant, bytecode
  - Compared to **CREATE** one has more control over contract generation

## Example code

### Flow

- `A` is the deployer contract for `B` using `CREATE2` which will always deploy B on same address as long as same `salt` is being passed
  - **Note:** Calling of selfdestruct is very important here, if the contract is still there you won't be able to deploy new contract on the same address e.g. deploy -> selfdestruct -> repeat
- `B` deploys `C` (good contract) first using `CREATE` here the nonce has increased by 1
- Now that `C` is deployed, using `kill()` contract is destroyed, making a vacancy for a new contract (Bad contract) on the same address
  - **Note:** Since nonce was previously increased, you wont be able to deploy a new contract on the same address
- Using `kill()` we destroy `B` and re-deploy it on the same address through contract `A`
- Now that the nonce has been reset on `B`, we can deploy `D` to the same address where `C` was previously deployed

## Mitigation

Always check if the contract you are planning to give authority is EOA or smart contract, has a function which call selfdestruct and is based on newer versions of solidity
