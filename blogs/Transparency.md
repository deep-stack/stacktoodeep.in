## Introduction

Every Ethereum transaction that gets processed is publicly accessible, including transactions visible within the open mempool. While having full visibility into another user's actions can sometimes lead to malicious behavior, this inherent level of transparency also provides significant benefits in terms of accountability and convenience, for example front/back-running transactions on DeFi, auction sniping, etc

## Mitigation

### Commit + Reveal

The commit-reveal pattern is a simple solution that protocols sometimes implement to allow users to commit to a concealed on-chain action that will be executed later. It often involves the protocol to having separate "commit" and "reveal" phases, with users making two transactions across them<br>

**The commit phase**<br>
In commit phase a user first sends a "commit" transaction to the protocol, which binds them to performing a specific action, the hash of the action details and some large, random, user-chosen salt value (e.g., commit = keccak256(ACTION, SALT)). Because hashes are uniqueâ„¢ and non-reversible, without knowing the salt value it's practically impossible to discover which action was chosen to generate the commit hash

**The reveal phase**<br>
In reveal phase users will submit a second, "reveal" transaction to the protocol, providing the salt and action they used to generate the prior commit hash. The protocol will compute the commit hash and, only if it matches the hash from the commit phase, perform the user's chosen action
