## Introduction

In Solidity smart contracts, external calls to unknow or untrusted contracts can expose your contract to a **reentrancy attack**. A reentrancy attack occurs when an attacker repeatedly calls the vulnerable contract's function before the original function completes, exploiting the contract's logic to withdraw funds multiple times before the state is updated.

This post will walk through the mechanics of a reentrancy attack, and how to protect your contracts using two common techniques: **Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI)** and **Reentrancy Guard**.

## How Reentrancy Attacks Work

Let’s break down how the reentrancy attack works using two contracts: `Victim` and `Attack`

- **Deposit Funds**: The attacker calls the `attack()` function in the `Attack` contract. This calls `victim.deposit()` to deposit some `ETH` into the `Victim` contract. The `Victim` contract updates the attacker's balance.<br>
- **Initial Withdrawal:** Next, the `attack()` function calls `victim.withdraw()` to withdraw the deposited `ETH` from the `Victim` contract. Here, the vulnerability is triggered because `withdraw()` sends the ETH back to the attacker before updating the balance.
- **Fallback Trigger:** Since `Victim.withdraw()` sends ETH to the attacker, the attacker's contract's fallback function (`fallback()`) is called, which once again calls `victim.withdraw()`. This happens before the balance of the attacker is updated in `Victim`, allowing them to withdraw more than they originally deposited.
- **Repeat:** This recursive call keeps draining funds from the `Victim` contract until all ETH is withdrawn or the transaction runs out of gas.

## How to Prevent Reentrancy Attacks

Here are two methods you can use to protect your contract from reentrancy attacks

### Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) Pattern

Refactoring your contract code in way that updates the state variables before handing over the execution control to some unknown address

By shifting the (`balances[msg.sender] = 0;`) before the external call, this way the attacker contract won't be able to take advantage of later state change since the balance will already be set to 0, preventing further withdrawals.

### Reentrancy Guard

Another method is to use a **reentrancy guard**, which is a simple boolean flag that locks the contract during execution, preventing any reentrant calls.

Here’s how you can implement it manually:

Alternatively, you can use **OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard** to handle this for you. Simply inherit the `ReentrancyGuard` contract and use the `nonReentrant` modifier

The `nonReentrant` modifier ensures that the `withdraw()` function cannot be called again until it completes execution.

## Conclusion

Reentrancy attacks can be devastating for smart contracts, allowing attackers to drain funds by exploiting logic vulnerabilities. By using the **Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI)** pattern or implementing **Reentrancy Guard**, you can safeguard your contracts from this common attack vector.

Always ensure your contract’s state is updated before external calls or use established libraries like **OpenZeppelin** to simplify protection measures.
